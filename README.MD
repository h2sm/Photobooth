## Photobooth
This project is basically a sharing service for photographers to make sharing their photos and videos with clients easier and, i hope, free. 

It saves photos/videos on a local server, creates a code and then with this code users can download a zip archive with all their photos and videos. 

Adding media realised through admin panel, where all passwords for all clients are shown. 

i made this because my mom pays too much (imo) for google drive and i decided to make my own photosharing service :/ also i had nothing better to do so... yeah

please hire me
